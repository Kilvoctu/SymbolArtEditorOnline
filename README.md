#### Version 1.5.0
  
*forked from https://github.com/malulleybovo/SymbolArtEditorOnline, who has since overhauled the UI*
  
*If you don't know how to use this old version, I do not provide support.*

## [*Play with it Here*](https://kilvoctu.github.io/SymbolArtEditorOnline/)


  
Inspired by the in-game editor from [Phantasy Star Online 2](http://pso2.jp/) (SEGA), 
Symbol Art Editor Online is a browser vector-based image editor used to produce digital art made of symbols.
The application supports *.sar* (Symbol Art files) and *.saml* (Art project files).

### [Disclaimer]
- Symbol Art Editor is a proprietary editor developed and owned by [SEGA](http://www.sega.com/). I do not own the idea of a Symbol Art Editor. This is purely a fan-made application inspired by SEGA's editor developed to let other fans and any curious artist have fun crafting symbol artwork outside of the game Phantasy Star Online 2 in a dedicated user-friendly editor engineered to be quick to use and that minimizes effort and repetition required to create quality symbol art. The only profit I expect from this application is people's happiness.
